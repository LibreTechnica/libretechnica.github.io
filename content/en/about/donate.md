If you would like to help cover some of the costs of operations, please consider a donation via Liberapay or Monero. 
Donations will primarily go to booking fees for meetups at local libraries (depending on the size of the meeting space, this may cost around $60/month) and to printed materials for education or promotions. Extra funds will go to hosting the LibreTechnica infrastructure (search engine, Lemmy instance, object storage) which currently comes in at $15/month. We appreciate your support!
