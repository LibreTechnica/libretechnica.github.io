## Reddit situation

## What is Lemmy

## Getting Started and basic how-to

### Finding communities

Sub-reddits are called **Communities** in Lemmy.  When you click on "Explore Communities" on a Lemmy instance, you will see three tabs.

- Subscribed - These are the communities you have susbscribed to, obviously.
- Local - These communitites are local to the instance you're viewing. Or, if you're using a mobile app, the instance that you're logged onto.
- All - Here are communities across multiple instances.  However, a community will only show up on this list once a user searches for it for the first time.  For example, searching for "privacy" on the https://libretechni.ca instance only shows a few communities on that topic (as of the date of this post).  But searching for "privacy" on https://lemmy.world shows a wealth of commuhities across numerous instances.  Over time, this list of will grow as subscribers who seek out and subscribe to more communities make their home instance "aware" of them.

### Subscribing

As you go about looking for Communities to subscribe to, I reccomend checking out some of the larger instances, searching for communities on there, and then subscribing from your home instance.  A great starting page is the GitHub Page, [Awesome Lemmy Instances](https://github.com/maltfield/awesome-lemmy-instances).  Here's a little rundown on how to find, say, a Community for cooking.

1.  Go to [Awesome Lemmy Instances](https://github.com/maltfield/awesome-lemmy-instances).  [Lemmy.world](https://lemmy.world/) has a lot of users, to go there and click on "Explore Communities".
2.  Search for "cooking".  Check out some of the Communities and see which one(s) you like.  The subscriber count there indicates how many subscribers the community has _from the local instance_. That's why those numbers don't match when you view the community from its home instance.
3.  Copy the link.  Note: these links are all views from the current instance.  So if you like "Science of Cooking@mander.xyz" community, the link on the search page will take you to **https://lemmy.world/c/cooking@mander.xyz**.
4.  Go back to your home instance and go to "Explore Communities".  Paste the copied URL in the search box, but take out the first part of the URL "https://lemmy.world/c/" and leave in "cooking@mander.xyz". Add an exclamation point to the beginning so it looks like "!cooking@mander.xyz".  Click "Search" and the Community will appear.
5.  Follow the link and subscribe.  This link will take you to "https://**libretechni.ca**/c/cooking@mander.xyz".

If no one else has subscribed to that Community before, the page might be blank.  But over time, the instance will add more posts and comments as they're federated to your home one.  So if you don't want to check out every Community on it's home instance, just go crazy on subscriptions and the content will steaadly come in after a day or so.
