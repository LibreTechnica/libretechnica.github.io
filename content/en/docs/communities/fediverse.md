Welcome to the Fediverse!  

The Fediverse, a cool term for "federated services", is a collection of services where individual instances are indepedently owned and operated, but work with other instances under standard protocols.  Just like with basic e-mail, anyone can run their own e-mail server and exchange messages with other ones across the internet.  Other federated (or _decentralized_) services work the same way.

It's for those reasons that we encourage their adoption over platforms like Twitter and Facebook.  Here are some more benefits:

- Data portability - You can often export your account with all your data and move to other instances.
- Privacy - Decentralized services don't run on the business model of selling your data.
- Open algorithms - Take comfort that you're not being fed rage-bait to keep you "engaged".   
- Censorship resistance - Decentralization makes is harder to quash dissenting opinions.
- Smaller communities - It's easy for your voice to be drowned out by the massive user base like Twitter's.
