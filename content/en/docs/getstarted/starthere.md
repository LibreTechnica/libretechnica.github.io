> "LibreTechnica shares knowledge about technologies developed for the benefit of the commons. By promoting open-source technologies that are free from and resistant to corporate control, government censorship, political coercion, and environmental harm, we can together heighten and sustain the common good." - From [About Us](https://www.libretechnica.org/about/aboutus/)

There are numerous ways you can liberate your technology.  But you may not want to maintain a server or organize a whole makerspace.  So we've broken down these solutions by scope; from a single person to a whole neighborhood and any size group in between.


### For Individuals
As a single, indivisble unit of humanity, you can make small changes over time that will give you back contorl over your digital life.  But it would be quite daunting to change your entire life's technology to socially-conscious alternatives.  That's why we've divided those measures into three challenges that appeal to different concerns that people might relate to most.

- The [FOSS Challenge](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/foss_challenge/) helps you switch to free and open software that you can trust.

- Take the [Privacy Challenge](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/privacy_challenge/) if you want to protect your personal and private information from corporate and government surviellance.

- The [Sustainability Challenge](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/sustainability_challenge/) puts your tech in an environmental prespective and helps eliminate e-waste.

### For Organizations and Families

Whether your're trying to get your artisan soap-making business off the ground or you want to avoid vendor lock-in for your non-profit, this section helps small to medium groups of people meet their collaboritive tech needs.  There are [resources for organizations and families](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/organizations/orgresources/) and [tools for business](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/organizations/business/) as well.

### For Communities

Better communities make better societies.  These [community resources](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/communities/communityresources/) will help make your neighborhods more vibrant and resilient through the power of shared collaboration.  We didn't forget about online communities either, the page on [federated services](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/communities/fediverse/) will show you decentralized social networks independent of corporate influence.
