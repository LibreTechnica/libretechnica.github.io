## Commercial – Ad-trackers, printers not scanning after ink runs out


###	Ads, adverts, and commercials. Oh my!

(Control over how your information is monetized) (Alt. Wait, so I am the product?!)


Many of us have taken advantage of the multitude of free services provided by tech companies.  And who could blame us?  They provide numerous conveniences and benefits to our lives.  We can use the most powerful data-finding algorithms to search for even the most obsure information; we can connect and reach out to nearly everyone we know on social network platforms; we can simply ask a sophisticated AI to get anything we want delivered to our front doors the day after we order it.

While it's hard to imagine what life would be like without these services, it's even hard to imagine their true costs to us.

"But hold on a sec, aren't those all free?"

Just because you don't pay money to use Google, Facebook, or Alexa, it doesn't mean you give nothing back to them.  To use those services, you must agree to let them collect, store, and leverage that data to make money.  Essentially, the cost to use those services is your personal data.

It's important to see companies like Google and Facebook for their business models.  We think of Google being in the business of internet technology, but they're truly an advertising company at their core.  Same with Facebook, 98% of their $86bn revenue in 2020 came from advertising.  https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000014/fb-20201231.htm  Facebook's customers are not the people posting status updates on their profiles; their customers are advertisers- and YOU are what they are buying access to!  Is getting angry at your uncle's Facebook rant worth the company having thousands of data-points on you?


- You are targeted for ads 6k-10k times per day
  - Who is making money off of you?

- Monopolies and duopolies dominate tech

- 1st Amendment does not apply to being deplatformed

- Companies have more control over the things you buy



### What you can do

- Use open-source technologies.

- Use services that do not monetize your private data.

- Just pay for services?
