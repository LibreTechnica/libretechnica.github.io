Using free and open-source (FOSS) software is one of the best ways you can liberate your technology.  The deeper you go into this challenge, the less dependent you are on commercial software ecosystems like Microsoft and Apple.  So let's begin the FOSS Challenge!

--------------------
### Level 1. Switch to FOSS alternatives to common software

The free software has a long history dating back decades.  Today, there are very few things you cannot do with free and open-source software.  

Keep in mind that there is a ton of "free" software that is not open-source.  Free but proprietary software like Google Chrome and Discord are not truly free in the 'libre' sense of the word, so you cannot view or change the source code.  LibreTechnica believes you should have complete visibility into your software.  Let's take a look at some alternatives. 

- Adobe Photoshop -> GIMP
- Microsoft Office -> LibreOffice
- Google Chrome -> Mozilla Firefox

Don't forget to try FOSS on your smartphone, too!  Many good alternative FOSS apps for your Android phone can be downloaded through F-Droid.

Check out these Resources for lists upon lists of FOSS alternitives!

*Security bonus* - use privacy tools like Signal.

--------------------
### Level 2. Install Linux on your desktop or laptop

At the core of our daily computing experience is the operating system.  You're most likely familiar with Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS, but did you know there is another way?  A way that offers more customization, faster performance, less malware, and absolutley zero user tracking?  Meet Linux, a family of open-source operating systems that you can install for free.  

There are many kinds of Linux to choose from, but don't let that scare you!  If you're complete new to using Linux, you can always try many distros in a virtual machine or on a live USB stick.  Here are some of the most common distros.

- Ubuntu
- Mint
- Manjaro

Check out these Resources for more information on making the switch!

--------------------
### Level 3. Switch to FOSS or privacy-focused services

Remove this if this isn't defined enough.

- OpenStreetMap is the only one I can think of at the moment.  



--------------------
### Level 4. Self-host your own services

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has added immense convenience to our lives.  Webmail has replaced the email client, cloud storage has replaced local backups, and even whole office suites are available on the web.  Many of these services require you to pay a subscription fee and let them have full access to your data, or you just host the services yoursel instead!  All you need is a home server or you can run a personal server instance on a cloud provider.  

One great starting point is NextCloud which can replace all of these services.
- Cloud storage (Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox)
- Calendar (Google Calendar)
- Contacts
- Mail
- Cloud office suites (Office 365, Google Docs)
- Chat and video conferencing (Microsoft Teams, Slack)

Check out these Resources for more information on self-hosting!

*Sustainability Bonus* - Use and old laptop or PC as your home server.

--------------------
### Level 5 (maybe). Use open-source hardware?

It's hard to believe that, with how complicated our electronic devices are these days, there are products that have completely open design and licenses.  Blah blah blah...
