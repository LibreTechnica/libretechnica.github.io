# The big questions


- How can I protect my personal data from being collected and used to generate profits for corporations?

- How can I protect my privacy from government surveillance?

- How can I reduce the environmental impact of the technology that I use?


# What you can do

We've devise three challenges that will help you liberate your technology and protect your data.  

**FOSS Challenge**

What's a better price than free?  Take the FOSS challenge and switch to free and open-source software.  

**Privacy Challenge**

Paranoid?  You should be!  By taking the Privacy Challenge, you will keep your data from prying eyes.

**Sustainability Challenge** 

Are you a maker, tinkerer, or hardware hacker?  Or perhaps you're environmentally conscious.  This is the challenge for you!

### Just pay for services?

It's might make it a little harder for Google deliver hyper-targeted ads to you if you don't get ads in the fist place!  This option may be controversial, as you're still allowing the service provider to harvest your data.  But at least you're saving huge amounts of time by not being forced to look at ads.
