This section of LibreTechnica is intended to help you answer these questions.

- How can I protect my personal data from being collected and used to generate profits for corporations?
- How can I protect my privacy from government surveillance?
- How can I reduce the environmental impact of the technology that I use?


# Take a challenge 

## Three paths to technology freedom

We've devised three challenges that will help you liberate your technology and protect your data.  

[**FOSS Challenge**](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/foss_challenge/)

What's a better price than free?  Take the FOSS challenge and switch to free and open-source software.  

[**Privacy Challenge**](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/privacy_challenge/)

Paranoid?  You should be!  By taking the Privacy Challenge, you will keep your data from prying eyes.

[**Sustainability Challenge**](https://www.libretechnica.org/docs/individuals/sustainability_challenge/)

Are you a maker, tinkerer, or hardware hacker?  Or perhaps you're environmentally conscious.  This is the challenge for you!
