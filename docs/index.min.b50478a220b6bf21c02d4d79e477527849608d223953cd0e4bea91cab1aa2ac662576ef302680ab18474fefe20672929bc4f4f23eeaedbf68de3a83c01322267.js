The deeper you go into this challenge, the less dependent you are on commercial software ecosystems like Microsoft and Apple. So let\u0026rsquo;s begin the FOSS Challenge!\n Level 1. Switch to FOSS alternatives to common software #\rThe free software has a long history dating back decades. Today, there are very few things you cannot do with free and open-source software.\nKeep in mind that there is a ton of \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; software that is not open-source. Free but proprietary software like Google Chrome and Discord are not truly free in the \u0026rsquo;libre\u0026rsquo; sense of the word, so you cannot view or change the source code. LibreTechnica believes you should have complete visibility into your software. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at some alternatives.\n Adobe Photoshop -\u0026gt; GIMP Microsoft Office -\u0026gt; LibreOffice Google Chrome -\u0026gt; Mozilla Firefox  Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to try FOSS on your smartphone, too! Many good alternative FOSS apps for your Android phone can be downloaded through F-Droid.\nCheck out these Resources for lists upon lists of FOSS alternitives!\nSecurity bonus - use privacy tools like Signal.\n Level 2. Install Linux on your desktop or laptop #\rAt the core of our daily computing experience is the operating system. You\u0026rsquo;re most likely familiar with Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS, but did you know there is another way? A way that offers more customization, faster performance, less malware, and absolutley zero user tracking? Meet Linux, a family of open-source operating systems that you can install for free.\nThere are many kinds of Linux to choose from, but don\u0026rsquo;t let that scare you! If you\u0026rsquo;re complete new to using Linux, you can always try many distros in a virtual machine or on a live USB stick. Here are some of the most common distros.\n Ubuntu Mint Manjaro  Check out these Resources for more information on making the switch!\n Level 3. Switch to FOSS or privacy-focused services #\rRemove this if this isn\u0026rsquo;t defined enough.\n OpenStreetMap is the only one I can think of at the moment.   Level 4. Self-host your own services #\rSoftware-as-a-Service (SaaS) has added immense convenience to our lives. Webmail has replaced the email client, cloud storage has replaced local backups, and even whole office suites are available on the web. Many of these services require you to pay a subscription fee and let them have full access to your data, or you just host the services yoursel instead! All you need is a home server or you can run a personal server instance on a cloud provider.\nOne great starting point is NextCloud which can replace all of these services.\n Cloud storage (Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox) Calendar (Google Calendar) Contacts Mail Cloud office suites (Office 365, Google Docs) Chat and video conferencing (Microsoft Teams, Slack)  Check out these Resources for more information on self-hosting!\nSustainability Bonus - Use and old laptop or PC as your home server.\n Level 5 (maybe).

And who could blame us? THey provide numerous conveniences and benefits to our lives. We can use the most powerful data-finding algorithms to search for even the most obsure information; we can connect and reach out to nearly everyone we know on social network platforms; we can simply ask a sophisticated AI to get anything we want delivered to our front doors the day after we order it.\nWhile it\u0026rsquo;s hard to imagine what life would be like without these services, it\u0026rsquo;s even hard to imagine their true costs to us.\n\u0026ldquo;But hold on a sec, aren\u0026rsquo;t those all free?\u0026rdquo;\nJust because you don\u0026rsquo;t pay money to use Google, Facebook, or Alexa, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you give nothing back to them. To use those services, you must agree to let them collect, store, and leverage that data to make money. Essentially, the cost to use those services is your personal data.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to see companies like Google and Facebook for their business models. We think of Google being in the business of internet technology, but they\u0026rsquo;re truly an advertising company at their core. Same with Facebook, 98% of their $86bn revenue in 2020 came from advertising. https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680121000014/fb-20201231.htm Facebook\u0026rsquo;s customers are not the people posting status updates on their profiles; their customers are advertisers- and YOU are what they are buying access to!
