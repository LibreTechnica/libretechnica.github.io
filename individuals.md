### Just pay for services?

It's might make it a little harder for Google deliver hyper-targeted ads to you if you don't get ads in the fist place!  This option may be controversial, as you're still allowing the service provider to harvest your data.  But at least you're saving huge amounts of time by not being forced to look at ads.
